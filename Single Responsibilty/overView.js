/* SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)

 This principle mean that, “a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.”
 Following this principle means that each class only does one thing and every class or module only has responsibility for one part of the software’s functionality.
 More simply, each class should solve only one problem.
 Single responsibility principle is a relatively basic principle that we are already utilizing to build code.
 It can be applied to classes, software components, and microservice.
 Utilizing this principle makes code easier to test and maintain, it makes software easier to implement, and it helps to avoid unanticipated side-effects of future changes.
