/*
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High level modules should not depend upon low level modules, Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
One popular way to comply with this principle is through the use of a dependency inversion pattern, although this method is not the only way to do so.
Whatever method you choose to utilize, finding a way to utilize this principle will make your code more flexible, agile, and reusable.
